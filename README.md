# Next.js Unexpected Token Error in Client-Side Component

This repository demonstrates a common Next.js error: "Unexpected token < in JSON at position 0" when trying to parse environment variables in a client-side component.  This error typically arises when you attempt to access environment variables directly within a component that's rendered on the client-side without using data fetching methods like `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`.

## Problem

The `about.js` file attempts to parse a JSON string from an environment variable.  This approach fails because environment variables are available only on the server-side during the build process. The client-side does not have access to these variables.

## Solution

The correct way to access environment variables in Next.js is to fetch the data on the server-side using `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`. These methods allow you to fetch data before the page renders on the client-side.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`. You'll observe the error.
5. Check out the `solution` branch to see the corrected code.

## Additional Notes

- Always use server-side data fetching methods to access environment variables, user data from databases, or any sensitive information.
- Client-side code should only work with data that has been already fetched on the server-side.
- The `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix is crucial when making environment variables accessible on the client-side, however this should still be done through the API routes for security reasons.
